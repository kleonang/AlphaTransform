# AlphaTransform: A Quantitative Trading Strategy Generation and Backtesting Framework 

AlphaTransform is a Reinforcement Learning-based Alpha Generation and Alpha Backtesting system. 

This repository contains a formulaic alpha generator using Reinforcement Learning (with a Transformer as the policy network) in `alphagen`, as well as a backtesting system in `backtester` that tests alphas generated by the alpha generator that can be used to train and test the alpha generator.

## Architecture
Here is a high-level overview of AlphaTransform's architecture:
